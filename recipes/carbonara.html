    <p>With crispy bits of pork, a peppery bite, and a velvety cheese sauce enriched with eggs, 
      </p>
    <p>Carbonara is just as easy to make for dinner as it is at 2 a.m. after a long night out. 
      </p>
    <p>It's one of Rome's signature dishes, and just like cacio e pepe and other pasta recipes in that class, 
      </p>
    <p>Its simplicity demands proper technique and quality ingredients.
      </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>100g pancetta</li>
        <li>50g pecorino</li>
        <li>50g parmesan</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>350g spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
        <li>50g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>salt & pepper</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Recipe</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.</li>
        <li>Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. 
          <p>Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.</p></li>
        <li>Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl,
            <p>Season with a little freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside.</p></li>
        <li>Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti, 
            <p>When the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente.</p></li>
        <li>Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.</li>
        <li>While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. 
            <p>Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.</p></li>
        <li>Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. 
            <p>The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.</p></li>
        <li>Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. 
            <p>Don't worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don't throw the pasta water away yet.</p></li>
        <li>Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.</li>
        <li>Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. 
            <p>Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn't scramble, and everything is coated.</p></li>
        <li>Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. 
            <p>If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.</p></li>
      </ol>
