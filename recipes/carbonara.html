    <p>With crispy bits of pork, a peppery bite, and a velvety cheese sauce enriched with eggs, 
      </p>
    <p>Carbonara is just as easy to make for dinner as it is at 2 a.m. after a long night out. 
      </p>
    <p>It's one of Rome's signature dishes, and just like cacio e pepe and other pasta recipes in that class, 
      </p>
    <p>Its simplicity demands proper technique and quality ingredients.
