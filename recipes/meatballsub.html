            <li>Pull the soft centre out of each roll and place in a food processor. Whiz to fine breadcrumbs, then add the mince, parsley, parmesan, chilli flakes, garlic and Worcestershire sauce. 
                <p>Pulse to combine, and season, then add the egg. Pulse until the mixture just comes together.</p></li>
            <li>Using damp hands, form mixture into 16 walnut-sized balls and place on a lined baking tray. Chill for 15 minutes to firm up.</li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a non-stick frypan over medium heat. Add the meatballs and cook, turning, for 6-8 minutes until golden and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Add the passata and bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and cook for a further 6-8 minutes until the sauce has thickened and reduced.</li>
            <li>Preheat grill to high. Place the rolls on a lined baking tray. Fill each roll with 4 meatballs and some tomato sauce, then top with gruyere. Grill for 1 minute or until the cheese starts to melt, then serve.</li>
